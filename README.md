## Deployment

This application uses Next.js API routes and requires a server runtime. The recommended deployment method is Vercel:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (free for hobby projects)
3. Create a new project in Vercel and connect it to your forked repository
4. Add your `SPORTRADAR_API_KEY` in Vercel:
   - Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add `SPORTRADAR_API_KEY` with your API key
   - Vercel will automatically encrypt and secure your API key

Vercel will automatically:
- Deploy your application
- Handle API routes correctly
- Manage environment variables securely
- Provide automatic HTTPS
- Enable automatic deployments on git push

### Alternative Deployment Options

If you prefer not to use Vercel, you can:
1. Use another hosting platform that supports Next.js API routes (Netlify, AWS, etc.)
2. Split the application into:
   - Frontend (static site on GitHub Pages)
   - Backend (serverless functions for API calls)

Note: GitHub Pages alone won't work because it doesn't support server-side functionality needed for the API routes.

## Environment Variables

This application requires the following environment variables to be set:

```bash
SPORTRADAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Required for fetching team data
```

You can get your API key by:
1. Creating an account at [SportRadar Developer Portal](https://developer.sportradar.com/)
2. Subscribing to the NCAA Men's Hockey API
3. Copying your API key from your dashboard

For local development:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key

For production deployment:
1. Add the `SPORTRADAR_API_KEY` environment variable to your hosting platform
   - For Vercel: Add in Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - For other platforms: Consult their documentation for adding environment variables

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
