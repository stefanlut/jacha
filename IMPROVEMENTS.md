# JACHA Enhancement Summary# Team Profiles Enhancement Summary



## Major Architecture Refactor (September 2025)## Completed Improvements



### Complete Team Schedules Implementation### 1. Dynamic Season Detection

The application has been completely refactored from a complex multi-site scraping system to a unified, maintainable College Hockey News-based architecture.- **What**: Replaced hardcoded "2024-25" season with dynamic calculation

- **Implementation**: Added `getCurrentSeason()` function that calculates the current hockey season based on the current date

## Key Improvements- **Files**: `src/app/api/teams/route.ts`, `src/app/teams/page.tsx`

- **Benefit**: Automatically shows the correct season without manual updates

### 1. **Unified Data Source Migration**

- **Previous**: Scraped 60+ individual athletics websites with varying formats### 2. API Response Caching

- **Current**: Single reliable data source (College Hockey News)- **What**: Implemented in-memory caching to reduce API calls and handle rate limiting

- **Benefits**: Consistent data format, easier maintenance, higher reliability- **Implementation**: Created `SimpleCache` utility class with TTL support and automatic cleanup

- **Files**: `src/app/utils/chnScheduleScraper.ts`- **Files**: 

  - `src/app/utils/cache.ts` (new)

### 2. **Team Schedules Page**  - `src/app/api/teams/route.ts` (5-minute cache)

- **Replaced**: Old "Team Profiles" page with schedule-focused functionality  - `src/app/api/teams/[teamId]/profile/route.ts` (10-minute cache)

- **Features**: Complete schedules for all 63 D1 hockey teams- **Benefit**: Reduces API calls, improves performance, and helps avoid rate limits

- **UI**: Clean two-column layout with team selector and schedule display

- **Files**: `src/app/teams/page.tsx`, `src/app/components/TeamSchedule*.tsx`### 3. Enhanced Loading States

- **What**: Replaced simple "Loading..." text with skeleton loading animations

### 3. **Advanced Team Selection**- **Implementation**: Added animated skeleton components that mimic the actual content structure

- **Search functionality** with real-time filtering- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamSelector.tsx`, `src/app/components/TeamProfile.tsx`

- **Conference-based filtering** for all 7 D1 hockey conferences- **Benefit**: Better user experience with visual loading feedback

- **Team count accuracy** (63 teams with duplicate detection)

- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamScheduleSelector.tsx`### 4. Search Functionality

- **What**: Added real-time search to help users find teams quickly

### 4. **Schedule Display Enhancement**- **Implementation**: 

- **Monthly organization** of games for better readability  - Search input filters teams by market name or team name

- **Home/away indicators** for each game  - Shows team count (e.g., "45 of 64 teams")

- **Conference vs non-conference** game identification  - Instant filtering as user types

- **Clean date formatting** and opponent display- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamSelector.tsx`

- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamScheduleDisplay.tsx`- **Benefit**: Easier team discovery, especially useful with 64 teams



### 5. **Simplified API Architecture**### 5. Visual Selection Indicator

- **Streamlined endpoints**: `/api/teams/list` and `/api/schedule`- **What**: Highlights the currently selected team in the team selector

- **No authentication required** (removed SportRadar dependency)- **Implementation**: Added blue background and border for selected team

- **Intelligent caching** with 10-minute TTL for performance- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamSelector.tsx`, `src/app/teams/page.tsx`

- **Files**: `src/app/api/teams/list/route.ts`, `src/app/api/schedule/route.ts`- **Benefit**: Clear visual feedback of current selection



### 6. **TypeScript Improvements**### 6. Enhanced Team Profile Design

- **Clean type definitions** for College Hockey News data structures- **What**: Redesigned team profile with better organization and visual hierarchy

- **Removed unused interfaces** from old SportRadar integration- **Implementation**: 

- **Better type safety** throughout the application  - Two-column layout for team information

- **Files**: `src/app/types.ts`  - Icons for different sections (conference, arena, players)

  - Improved typography and spacing

### 7. **Navigation Updates**  - Player roster with sorting by jersey number

- **Updated link text** from "Team Profiles" to "Team Schedules"  - Detailed player information display

- **Consistent navigation** across all pages- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamProfile.tsx`

- **Files**: `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/components/Header.tsx`- **Benefit**: More professional appearance and better information organization



## Code Quality Improvements### 7. Retry Functionality

- **What**: Added retry buttons for failed API calls

### Removed Legacy Code- **Implementation**: 

- ❌ `program_schedule_sites.csv` (60+ team URLs)  - Retry buttons appear on error states

- ❌ `scheduleScraper.ts` (multi-site scraper)  - Automatic retry counter resets on success

- ❌ Old API endpoints (`/api/teams/route.ts`, `/api/scrape-schedule/`, etc.)  - Separate retry state for teams list and individual profiles

- ❌ Unused React components (`TeamProfile.tsx`, `TeamSelector.tsx`, `TeamSchedule.tsx`)- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamSelector.tsx`, `src/app/components/TeamProfile.tsx`

- ❌ Deprecated TypeScript interfaces- **Benefit**: Users can recover from temporary network issues without page refresh



### Enhanced Error Handling### 8. Scrollable Team List

- **Graceful error boundaries** for better user experience- **What**: Added maximum height and scrolling to team selector

- **Descriptive API error messages** with helpful guidance- **Implementation**: `max-h-96 overflow-y-auto` on the teams grid

- **Team validation** with suggestions for correct team names- **Files**: `src/app/components/TeamSelector.tsx`

- **Loading states** and skeleton UI components- **Benefit**: Prevents the component from taking up too much vertical space



### Performance Optimizations## Technical Improvements

- **API response caching** reduces server load

- **Efficient team mapping** with aliases support### Performance

- **Lazy loading** of schedule data- API response caching reduces redundant network requests

- **Optimized build size** after removing unused code- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

- Efficient team filtering with `useMemo` patterns

## Technical Achievements

### User Experience

### Data Accuracy- Loading skeletons provide better perceived performance

- **Fixed team count**: 74 → 63 teams (removed duplicates)- Search functionality makes team discovery fast

- **Opponent parsing**: Fixed missing opponent names issue- Error states with retry options improve reliability

- **Eliminated artifacts**: Removed "CCompare" text from schedules- Visual selection feedback enhances usability



### Developer Experience### Code Quality

- **Clean API design** with intuitive endpoints- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

- **Comprehensive documentation** in README.md- Separated concerns with utility modules

- **Type-safe development** with proper TypeScript interfaces- Error handling with graceful degradation

- **Easy deployment** with no external API keys required- Clean component architecture



### User Experience## Current State

- **Responsive design** works on all device sizes

- **Fast loading** with skeleton states and cachingThe team profiles page now provides:

- **Intuitive navigation** between rankings and schedules1. **64 NCAA Division I Men's Hockey teams** properly filtered and sorted

- **Clean, modern interface** with dark mode support2. **Dynamic season detection** (currently showing "2025-26 Season")

3. **Fast search and selection** with visual feedback
